# Radio Emka <img src="./src/assets/logo/m-medium-elevation.png" alt="app logo" width="30"/>

Simple, yet useful radio player. It has been based on API calls found on my favourite radio station website.
It serves a single purpose of playing the radio. The playback can be controlled via notification, smartwatch, headphones etc. Longpress the song title to copy it.

## Environment variables

To build working app by your own you have to provide environment variables in `.env` file. Take [.env.sample](.env.sample) as an example. Those variables are injected using [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config).
